	#### Comparable Vs Comparator ####
Comparable and Comparartor both are Interfaces 

Comparable -	
	1. java.lang package
	2. compareTo method
	3. used to compare this.object == other.object
	4. comparision logic is written inside the class
	5. Natural Ordering (Inbuilt Ordering)
	6. interface Comparable <T>{
		int compareTo(T o);
	   }
	7. Arrays.sort(arr); (Internally uses Quick Sort)

Comparator -
	1. java.util package
	2. compare method
	3. used to compare two objects outside class
	4. comparision logic is written outside the class
	5. No Natural Ordering	
	6. interface Comparator <T>{
		int compare (T obj1 , T obj2);
	   }
	7. Arrays.sort(arr,new ProductPriceAscComparator); (Internally uses QuickSort)
