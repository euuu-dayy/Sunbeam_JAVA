🧨 What is the “Fragile Base Class Problem”?
📚 Definition:
The Fragile Base Class Problem is a fundamental issue in object-oriented programming where changes to a base class (or interface) can unintentionally break subclasses (or implementers) — even if those subclasses didn’t change.

It’s called “fragile” because the base is so delicate — a tiny change can shatter everything built on top of it.

⚠️ How It Applies to Interfaces (Fragile Base Interface Problem)
Even though interfaces don’t have implementation (traditionally), they define a contract.

So if you:

Add a new abstract method → all implementers break.
Change a method signature → all implementers break.
Remove a method → all implementers break.
→ That’s fragility. One change in the “base” (interface) → breaks all “derived” classes.

✅ Fragile Base Interface Problem — SOLVED 
With interfaces + default methods:

You add a new default method → subclasses don’t break → they inherit safe fallback.
No internal state → no hidden assumptions → safe to evolve.
Conflict resolution is explicit (you must override if two interfaces conflict).
🟢 Solved by design in Java 8+.

🚫 Fragile Base Class Problem — NOT SOLVED (But Can Be Mitigated) 
❗ Why It’s Harder to Solve:
🧱
State & Implementation Coupling
Subclasses inherit fields, internal logic, side effects — not just contracts.
🔄
Method Call Chains
Base class calls
this.method()
→ which might be overridden → behavior changes unexpectedly.
🎯
Assumptions in Subclasses
Subclass may assume
super.method()
does X → if you change it → subclass breaks.
⛔
No “Default” Safety Net
Unlike interfaces, you can’t add “safe fallback” methods to classes without risking breakage
