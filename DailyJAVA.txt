#1.Course Contents Explaination 

#2.Java History , Versions 
	
JAVA 8 (LTS)
James Gosling - Father of Java Programming language
Pavni Diwanji (Indian who worked in sun microsystems and was in the development team for development of servlet)

Applet - Small java program which runs on a server
Java ME (Micro edition) => Mobile development 
Java SE (Standard edition) => Desktop app development
Java EE (Enterprise edition) => Web Development
 
#3.Java Installation (Directory Structures) 

- Installed JDK version 21
	We saw the folder structure in JDK -
	1. bin => java libraries [ java compiler(javac.exe) + app launcher (java.exe) + debugger ]
	2. include => Header files required for JNI programming (Java Native Interface)
		JNI - (Integration of C/CPP in java)
	3. jre => app launcher (java.exe) + rt.jar(java archives) + jvm.dll (supporting libraries)
	4. src.zip => source codes of java classes like (System class, Scanner class , PrintStream class) THEREFORE (JAVA IS OPEN SOURCE) [1]
	

#4.Creating simple hello-world on notepad(open the terminal , save file ,Compilation and execution) (src to byte code)

	javac Program.java - convert java source code into byte code [.class file]
	java Program -  [.class] file is passed to JVM (bytecode to machine code) 

#5.Explaining Compilation of Java Program with Diagram

	Program.java using(java compiler) => Program.class (using applauncher) => JVM 
	JVM - consists of  4 parts 
		1. class loader - (loads .class files into memory area )
		2. Memory Area - (three type of memory STACK, HEAP , METHOD) 
		3. JIT + Interpreter - JIT (Just in time Compilation) used for caching same statements which are used frequently (like system.out.println)
		4. Garbage Collector - Automatic memory management (Automatic frees the object)

	rt.jar => precompiled classes like (System.class , Integer class , String class etc) 
	--------
	~ If we use System.out.println then it only loads System.class not others , only required classes are used and loaded 
		THEREFORE (JAVA IS DYNAMIC) [2]

#6.JDK VS JRE

Development Tools - Compiler , Debugger , Preprocessor , etc

SDK => Development Tools + Documentation + Runtime Environment + Supporting Libraries
	
JDK => Java Development Tools + Java Documentation + Java Runtime Environment + Java Supporting libraries

JDK => Java Development Tools + Java Documentation + JVM + rt.jar

JDK => Java Development Tools + Java Documentation + JRE [JVM + rt.jar]

ON DEVELOPER MACHINE => JDK + JRE 
ON CLIENT MACHINE => JRE (only)

(JAVA IS PLATFORM DEPENDENT) [3]

#8.Creating a notepad file with multiple class 

Program.java file =>
class First {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("First");
	}
}

class Second {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Second");
	}
}

class Third {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Third");
	}
}

--------------------------------------------------------
Output=>

Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26100.6584]

C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop>java Program
Error: Could not find or load main class Program
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Program

C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop>java First
First

C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop>java Second
Second

C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop>java Third
Third
-------------------------------------------------------
CONSIDER classes are not public 
~ We can write multiple clases in single .java file 
~ For each class separate .class file is created (First.class , Second.class , Third.class) 
~ We need to execute every .class file by giving separate java command 
~ We cannot write multiple public classes in single .java file 
~ Name of the public class and filename should be same
~ Multiple public classes are written in multiple .java files

#9.Creating a notepad file with multiple class but one public class (Show error)

#10.Creating the first Hello world Program in STS (Explanation) 

public class Program {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("HelloWorld");
	}
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation =>  

class  System {
	static Printstream out ;    //Association
}

System.out.println("HelloWorld");

We have 2 perspectives - 
1. System is a class in java.lang package , out is a static member of the System class.
2. println is a method of the PrintStream class.

#11.Classpath 

#12.Classpath demo notepad (Hello world)
    

#13.Method overload Multiple main (in STS) 

#14.Main case sensitive 

#15.Data types 

	Primitive - GETS SPACE ON STACK SECTION

	Non-Primitive (Reference types) - GETS SPACE ON HEAP SECTION

#17.Area of rectangle (len, br , area ) 

#16.Scanner class (user-name , roll , marks) (Problem) 

	In java.util package

#18.Narrowing and widening 

Widening - no explicit casting required

Narrowing - explicit casting is required


~ (JAVA IS STRONGLY TYPED) [4]
~ we can give same name to method but different arguments this concepts is called as method overloading
~ main method in java can be overloaded 
~ JVM only identifies 
	public static void main (String [] args)
